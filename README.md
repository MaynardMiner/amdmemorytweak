## Tips (Although i'm not expecting too much..)
BTC
  * 3GBgapb49BZ7fBPXnbetqbnMn2KiGNzUXf
  
ETH
  * 0x8C77C212da3e12cad1AfB8824CF74b1CC04d2F7C
  
In the unlikely event of not owning either BTC or ETH and you do want to be an amazing person and tip,
shapeshift, changelly, simpleswap, ... are great ways to solve that "issue" ;-)
